### Security

By doing nothing more than adding the security starter to the project build, you get the following security features:
1. All HTTP request paths require authentication.
2. No specific roles or authorities are required.
3. Authentication is prompted with a simple login page.
4. Thereâ€™s only one user; the username is user.
